# BPI (Ball Program Interface)

Basic Go bindings for the NBA's open data portals. This is very much a WIP and
should not be used until more functionality & tests are added. 

## Basic Roadmap:
- Cover most of data.nba.net's json files
- Cover some of stats.nba.net for advanced stats stuff
- Add database support to auto create database & populate
